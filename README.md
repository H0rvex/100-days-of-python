# Python learning projects
My learning projects in Python

Mostly only beginner-intermediate projects which I have done throughout my learning curve. 

For the 'coffee machine' project I revised my code and reconstructed it with the logic of the learned conecpt 'OOP' (Object oriented programming).
This is only the beginning for my journey, I am planning on starting more complex programs for real-world use cases and problems, or committing to open-source projects.

I will also specialise in a certain field later on, maybe when I am midway through my cs degree, but establishing a solid foundation is essential in my opinion.
